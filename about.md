# About

Hi I'm Claudio Catalani.I was taught to play chess when I was 5 years old by my father as a family tradition's sport. Then I started to play chess in the local club between 6 and 8 years old. Playing chess was an important activity along my life to train my focus and insight for my life, and was a key role in choosing my career path. I wrote down my first lines of code when I was 12 years old and did few programming courses in computer programming institution; at that time, my dream was to develop software with artificial intelligence. 

I went to the Naval Service to become an officer and learned about military discipline, leadership, engineering, and naval weapons. I'm a goal-oriented and self-motivated professional, able to deliver creative solutions to any problem. Nowadays, back to the roots in computer science and programming, I enjoy unleashing the power of computers to solve problems in the finance industry. My background in math, engineering, programming makes me a suitable candidate to solve challenging projects.

### Coding
I attended to 2 yearly programming courses using FoxPro language. In this course I've been introduced to basic programming concepts as :
 - Sequential execution
 - Conditional execution
 - Iterative execution
 - Data Structures
 - Object Oriented Programming 
As part of the course, I developed a data base program. The course was complemented with long hours of coding at home. Period : Jan 2000 to Dec 2001.
